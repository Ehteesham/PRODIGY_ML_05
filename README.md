# Fruit Image Recognition and Calorie Prediction.

## Summary

- This project uses a CNN model to detect fruits in images.
- It then scrapes calorie information for the detected fruits.
- To make predictions, simply download this repository and run the following command:

  ```shell
  python app.py
  ```
